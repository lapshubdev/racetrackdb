## RacetrackDB

Welcome to RacetrackDB, an open-source database containing information about racetracks around the world! This repository is part of the LapsHub project, and its mission is to provide an up-to-date, community-maintained resource for motorsport enthusiasts, track-day organizers, and developers.

### Features
- JSON format for easy integration.
- Contributions welcome from anyone.
- Built with community support to keep track data current and accurate.

### Why Contribute?
Racetracks change over timeâ€”names, configurations, or even closures. With your help, RacetrackDB can stay relevant and accurate for all motorsport enthusiasts.

### Usage
The database is stored in a racetracks.json file in this repository. It contains the following fields for each racetrack:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for the racetrack.
- **Name**: The official name of the racetrack.
- **Avatar**: Path to an image representing the racetrack.
- **Avatar Panorama**: Path to a panoramic image of the racetrack.
- **Length**: Track length (in miles).
- **GPS Shape**: A series of latitude and longitude points outlining the track.
- **Configurations**: List of different layouts or configurations for the track.
- **Finish Line Polygon**: Coordinates defining the finish line area.
- **GPS Location**: Central latitude and longitude of the track.
